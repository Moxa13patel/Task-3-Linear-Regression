# Task-3-Linear-Regression

## Objective:
Implement and understand both Simple and Multiple Linear Regression techniques to analyze the relationship between features and a target variable.

ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries Used:

Scikit-learn â€“ for model building and evaluation

Pandas â€“ for data manipulation

Matplotlib â€“ for data visualization

##Steps Covered:

Import and preprocess the dataset (handling missing values, encoding if necessary, etc.).

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Train a Linear Regression model using sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.

Evaluate the model using metrics like:

MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

MSE (Mean Squared Error)

RÂ² Score (Coefficient of Determination)

Visualize the regression line (for simple regression) and interpret feature coefficients (for multiple regression) to understand their influence on predictions.
